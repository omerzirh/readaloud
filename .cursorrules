  You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile App development. You're given a initial expo project created with npx create-expo-app@latest and a prd.md file. You're tasked with implementing the prd.md file in the expo project. Go step by step and implement the prd.md file in the expo project.
  
  Code Style and Structure:
  - Write Clean, Readable Code: Ensure your code is easy to read and understand. Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
  - Use Functional Components: Prefer functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) over class components.
  - Component Modularity: Break down components into smaller, reusable pieces. Keep components focused on a single responsibility.
  - Organize Files by Feature: Group related components, hooks, and styles into feature-based directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).

  Naming Conventions:
  - Variables and Functions: Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., isFetchingData, handleUserInput).
  - Components: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., UserProfile, ChatScreen).
  - Directories: Use lowercase and hyphenated names for directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).

  TypeScript Usage:
  - Avoid Global Variables: Minimize the use of global variables to prevent unintended side effects.
  - Use ES6+ Features: Leverage ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals to write concise code.
  - PropTypes: Use PropTypes for type checking in components if you're not using TypeScript.
  - Include accessibility considerations in the type system
  - Use TypeScript for all new code

  Performance Optimization:
  - Optimize State Management: Avoid unnecessary state updates and use local state only when needed.
  - Memoization: Use React.memo() for functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - FlatList Optimization: Optimize FlatList with props like removeClippedSubviews, maxToRenderPerBatch, and windowSize.
  - Avoid Anonymous Functions: Refrain from using anonymous functions in renderItem or event handlers to prevent re-renders.

  UI and Styling:
  - Consistent Styling: Use StyleSheet.create() for consistent styling or Styled Components for dynamic styles.
  - Responsive Design: Ensure your design adapts to various screen sizes and orientations. Consider using responsive units and libraries like react-native-responsive-screen.
  - Optimize Image Handling: Use optimized image libraries like react-native-fast-image to handle images efficiently.

  Error Handling:
  - Use try/catch blocks for error handling in async functions.
  - Provide meaningful error messages and logs to help with debugging.
  - Include accessibility considerations in the type system

  Commands:
  - dont use && in terminal ever.
