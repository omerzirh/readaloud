# WhatsApp Message Reader - Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview
WhatsApp Message Reader is a React Native Android application designed to help users who have difficulty reading by providing an easy-to-use text-to-speech functionality for WhatsApp messages through Android's share functionality. The primary target users are elderly individuals or those who cannot read or write but want to stay connected with their family and friends through WhatsApp.
